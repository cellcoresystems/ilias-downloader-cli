# Ilias Downloader

This is a reimplementation of the original [IliasDownloader2](https://github.com/kekru/ILIASDownloader2) by Kevin Krummenauer (kekru).

## Differences from the original version
- This version aims to have a clearer code base.
- It features a new UI built with [JavaFX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX).

## Getting started
In order to start the application you need at least an installed JRE 8 Update 60.
If you have not installed Java or an older version you can get it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
